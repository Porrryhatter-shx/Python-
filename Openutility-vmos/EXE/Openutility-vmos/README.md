1. Install PyInstaller:
   Run the command `pip install pyinstaller` in your terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   Use the command `cd path_to_your_project/Openutility-vmos`.

3. Create the executable:
   Run the command `pyinstaller --onefile Openutility.py`. This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist` folder.

4. Find the executable:
   After the process completes, you can find your EXE file in the `dist` directory created within your project folder.

Make sure to test the executable to ensure it runs as expected.
